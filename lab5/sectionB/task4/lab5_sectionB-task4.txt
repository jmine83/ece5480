>> Circuit 1 has two inputs, two outputs, and seven internal wire nodes.
>> Circuit 2 has one test control input, one output, and eight internal wire nodes.
>> Circuit 3 has one test control input, one clear input, one output, and nine internal wire nodes.
>> All circuit have the same sequential depth of 3.
